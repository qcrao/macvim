When editing the command-line (: / etc.), press Ctrl-P or Ctrl-N to complete the word before the cursor, using keywords in the current file. E.g: you want to search for "elephant" in the buffer, just type /ele and press Ctrl-P. So long as "elephant" is in the buffer, you will get "ele" completed into "elephant".

This script is functional similar with (but far more better than) SearchComplete vimscript #474 (version 1.1).
